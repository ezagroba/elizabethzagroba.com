.. description: Talks, workshops, panels, interviews, and AMAs I've done, plus software communities and peer conferences I'm a part of. 

## Software Communities 

- I co-organize Friends of Good Software conference ([FroGSConf](https://frogsconf.nl/)).
- I've spoken at and served on the program committee for [Agile Testing Days](https://agiletestingdays.com/), the [Hungarian Software Testing Forum (HUSTEF)](https://hustef.hu/), and the Agile Alliance.
- I've done a bunch of stuff for the [Ministry of Testing](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/): spoken at TestBashes, written articles, reviewed abstracts, had people Ask Me Anything live and on the club, facilitated a 99-minute workshop, joined a fireside chat, and volunteered at a TestBash. 

## Presentations

### Invite me to present about these topics

- exploratory testing
- test reporting
- ensemble testing (mob testing)
- a variety of lightning talks stolen from my blog

### Upcoming events

For 2025, I have a couple of peer conferences I hope to participate in, but no specific speaking engagements just yet!
