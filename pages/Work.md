### Bio

Elizabeth is Quality Lead at [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com/) in The Netherlands. She's appreciated as an exploratory tester with an “[extraordinary power of observation and categorization](https://www.exploratorytestingacademy.com/appreciationmap/index.html).” She discovers and fills in the gaps in exploratory testing by coordinating integration testing, actively listening, and setting out to prove that when “it should just work” it actually does. She's the go-to person for thinking critically about what’s being built, creating a common understanding, supporting colleagues outside the prescribed management structure, and writing API tests and English effectively.

She injects what she learns from books, conferences, and meetups into her daily work, spreading her knowledge through the workshops and book club she facilitates. Her goal is to build enough skills in individuals and teams to make herself redundant. She’s currently serving as a co-organizer for the Friends of Good Software Conference ([FroGS Conf](https://frogsconf.nl/])), and as a program committee member for [Agile Testing Days](https://frogsconf.nl/). 

You can find Elizabeth's big thoughts on this blog and little thoughts on [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@ez).
