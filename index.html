    <div>
<p>One of the tasks for my team last week was updating an existing GET API call in our specification with some new fields. The <a href="https://swagger.io/specification/">Open API Specification</a>, formerly known as Swagger, allows you to provide the details for building in API in a compact, informative way. When you've got the authentication set up correctly, you can use the examples to actually call the API right from the spec!</p>
<p>My team builds with a framework that has the power to auto-generate API specs in this format. We've chosen to write them ourselves rather than have them auto-generated so we can be more specific in what kinds of errors and error messaging people will encounter for different calls. For example, a 404 Not Found might make sense on a GET call for a specific resource, but not for a search call.</p>
<p>When you open <a href="http://editor.swagger.io/">http://editor.swagger.io/</a>, you should see a two-pane view of the editor on the left and the rendering on the right. If you've opened this URL before, your browser session will remember and display your most recent changes. If it's the first time you've opened it, the example specification of the Swagger Petstore should appear like this:</p>
<p><span class="img_container" style="display: inline-block;"><img alt="" src="images/posts/2020/petstore-example-spec.png" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Petstore example spec"><span class="img_caption" style="display: block; text-align: center;">Petstore example spec</span></span></p>
<p>I hope that in describing the errors I encountered, you can keep an eye on them as you're editing rather than having to go back through the specification at the end to figure out what went wrong. </p>
<h3>Errors I encountered</h3>
<h4>Red errors in the box at the top and next to line numbers in editor</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2020/swagger-red-error-at-top.png"></p>
<p>Indentation errors and using reserved characters (I found square brackets, dashes, colons at least fall into this category) in unexpected ways will likely give you an error in a red box between the navigation and the title of the spec. </p>
<p>If you're lucky, the error corresponds to the line it mentions, you find a red X on that line, and you'll be able to figure out what went wrong there. </p>
<p>If you're less lucky, the line mentioned in the red box will refer to the beginning of the next code block that's unparsable because of the syntax error, or the first place where the reserved character you've used incorrectly is actually used correctly. </p>
<p>The hardest part about these errors is that you may not notice them. If you're scrolled down the page far enough, you won't see the error box or the red X as you're creating the error. </p>
<h4>Spinning without loading</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2020/swagger-spinner-failed-reference.png"></p>
<p>If you're getting a spinner where a part of the specification should be loading, you've got a issue with the reference to a schema. <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/">Schemas</a> allow you to chunk out and reuse part of the spec, with a reference to them in another place. </p>
<p>I kept getting the spinner when I referred to a schema that didn't exist, either because I'd updated the name (but not the reference to it) or because I'd screwed up whether it was singular or plural. Fixing the error isn't always enough to make this particular error disappear. Reloading the page will make it re-evaluate what you've got. </p>
<h4>😱 could not render this component, see the console.</h4>
<p>What a fun and exciting mistake you've made in the specification, to cause this very comforting and reassuring error message. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2020/swagger-scream.png"></p>
<p>Like the endless spinning error, this one means something very specific: you've designated something as an array, but you haven't explained what kinds of items appear in the array. <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#array">Adding a description or reference in the items section</a> should do the trick. </p>
<h3>Editing without the Open API editor</h3>
<p>It's possible the Open API web editor was not the best tool for this job. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2020/swagger-vs-code.png"></p>
<p>The <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi">Visual Studio Code Open API plugin</a> did make the red errors obvious enough that you could see them from anywhere in the document. It also gave me the collapsed version of the longer spec in alphabetical order. This allowed me to navigate around without remembering the line numbers of where I dumped the schema separately from the overall spec. Unfortunately the extension didn't catch when I referred to a spec that didn't exist, but I expect seeing the list of schemas on the side would help discover this mistake. The extension also if I didn't define the objects in an array.  </p>
<p>There's also an <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Open API spec tool for offline use</a>, but the instructions went beyond the interest I had for this blog post. Try it out yourself, and maybe I will the next time I've got to edit these specs. </p>

<p>TestBash Brighton was one of 10,000 things I had to do in the weeks just before I left my whole life (family, friends, job, apartment, belongings) and moved across the ocean into the unknown. It was the first place I'd gotten to share that big news in person, with people who would become larger parts of my life once I moved. Visiting the city where I'd studied during university and first thought "I could leave the United States" brought things full circle for me. </p>
<p>I paired on presenting a brand-new workshop and talk, with two different people. This would have been a lot, even without all the uncertaincies and distractions swirling in my life those days. After hustling to adjust the schedule of and present our morning workshop, I distinctly remember choosing to skip the afternoon one I'd planned on attending in order to fill out immigration and relocation paperwork. I'm shocked to find I was able to focus enough on some other peoples' talks to take coherent notes about them.</p>

<hr>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/anusha_n">Anusha Nirmalananthan</a>'s talk about sharing a chronic illness sticks with me today. One of the things I love to jump into is troubleshooting. I hear about a problem, and I'm already thinking of ways to solve it, and asking about what you've tried already. Anusha reminded us that listening and not saying anything can be more helpful and powerful than all the patronizing "Have you tried...?" questions in the world.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ewebber">Emily Weber</a> spoke about communities of practice, which have always been billed as "guilds" in places where I've worked. Emily encouraged us to connect with people around our organizations in our discipline in a supportive, voluntary group without a hierarchy or an end date. While the occasional guild meeting I've attended has turned into a groan-fest, dedicating time and energy to fostering change (to code, to job descriptions, to your team's way of working, etc.) gives me that "I did something today" feeling. I'm grateful to be able to make time to learn with my colleagues, and build a support network for when I need advice from outside the bubble of my team. </p>
<hr>
<p>I loved <a href="https://twitter.com/Rosicadia">Rosie Hamilton</a>'s talk about logic in testing because it drove me back to the basics. How do we decide what is true? How do I describe my thought process? When the availability of relevant cases prevents effective inductive reasoning (determining a heuristic), we have to move to abductive reasoning (determining the likeliest explanation from the available information). Realizing when you're doing this and what other information might be available to you elevates your testing.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2020/logic.jpg"></p>
<hr>
<p>Looking back at my notes from <a href="https://twitter.com/AWGHodder">Aaron Hodder</a>'s talk on structured exploratory testing make me realize how much freedom I can have in my testing when working with an inattentive team. His suggestions about making for easier reporting, fewer rabbit holes, and predictability of a time-table suggest that someone is really breathing down your neck about the status, progress, and depth of your work. The biggest advantage I've had in sharing my testing charters with my team is that I find out which ones aren't valuable before I spend time executing them. Actively choosing not to test something when we don't care about the outcome or the risk it poses is very effective work.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alanpage">Alan Page</a> spoke about the modern testing principles he'd been shaping on his podcast for a while. My notes boil it down to: testers should do less testing and more coaching. This has certainly served me on teams producing too much for me to personally go as deep as I'd like in testing, but it also pays off when I'm out of the office or unavailable at the office. Working on a team that knows how to test means I get to look at higher-quality code, with more interesting bugs. </p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/northern_tester">Ash Winter</a> gave a talk immediately after mine, so perhaps I did not gather everything from it. But I did save these tid-bits: a pipeline is built to prove that something shouldn't go out. A pipeline can provide a massive amount of information, but without a strategy, too much data doesn't help humans make better decisions. Small things you can do to make huge improvements: deploy regularly, and learn source control.</p>
<hr>
<p>Reflecting on the open space, the social events, and the atmosphere at TestBash Brighton 2018 makes me wish for the experience we all missed at the now-cancelled event in 2020. Jumping into the unknown seemed so doable when I knew there'd be so many people to share with and learn from on this side of the Atlantic. I don't know when I'll see you all again, but I look forward to that possibility. </p>

<p name="1b99" id="1b99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">It’s possible I’d seen a causal loop disgram before, but it wasn’t until I went to Jo Perold and Barry Tandy’s “Visualize your way to better problem solving” workshop that I knew the name for them. <a href="https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/cause-effect/causal-loop-diagrams-little-known-analytical-tool/" data-href="https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/cause-effect/causal-loop-diagrams-little-known-analytical-tool/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here’s an example of how connecting nouns with verbs via bubbles and letters really clears things up.</a></p>

That allows us to have a conversation about the model, discover if we’re on the same page, and take steps to improve the model and ultimately the software.

<p name="c76c" id="c76c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leo Hepis and Danie Roux’s “Frames at Work” workshop blew my mind. I would tell you they were talking about how metaphors and context framing shape the way we think about our work. And they did that. But the meandering and level of lost I felt on our path there was unprecedented.</p>

<p><span class="img_container" style="display: inline-block;"><img alt="" src="images/posts/2019/rope.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Our table selected “Rope of Awesome” and I stand by that answer."><span class="img_caption" style="display: block; text-align: center;">Our table selected “Rope of Awesome” and I stand by that answer.</span></span></p>
<p name="e4cd" id="e4cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">One of the exercises had us listening to a story about someone’s work and only writing down the metaphors. There seemed to be one every sentence, so many that I thought the speaker was throwing them in there on purpose. (See: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">throwing</em>. They’re everywhere!) He talked about “pulling” and “dragging” his team along. Imagine instead if he were “pushing” or “building” his team. How would he think differently about his work? How different would his work be? Listen more closely to the words people are using to discover terrifying news about how they perceive their work!</p>

<p name="b1ad" id="b1ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alison Gitelson hosted a session to help the conference attendees think more about what they’d just learned. I was still reeling from the metaphors and framing session, so I wrote down these questions for myself:</p>

<p name="1393" id="1393" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Something is wrong. It’s obvious from the data itself. We don’t know exactly where the problem is or how to fix it, but we can tell there’s something funky with either <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Address</code> or <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Last Name</code> or both.

<p name="2031" id="2031" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Let’s look at a real-life example: I’m writing an automated test for an API. First, I create (POST) an item, then I read (GET) the database to see if it’s there. One of the fields in the body of the POST call is a Universally Unique Identifier, or UUID.</p>
<p name="9c80" id="9c80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A UUID is a 128-bit identifier; we’re using them as unique keys in our database. Here’s an example of a version 4 UUID: <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">74ee94d-d32f-4844-9def-81f0d7fea2d8</code>. (If you’re a human that can’t read regex, <a href="https://www.regextester.com/99148" data-href="https://www.regextester.com/99148" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you might find this useful</a>.) I generated that using the <a href="https://www.uuidgenerator.net" data-href="https://www.uuidgenerator.net" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Online UUID Generator Tool</a>.</p>
<p name="467d" id="467d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wanted to see what would happen if I tried to POST with a UUID that wasn’t valid. If I’d taken my example UUID and removed some characters to make it <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">74e4d-d32f-4844-9def-81f0ea2d8</code>, it would have been invalid. My test would have behaved as I expected. But I wouldn’t have been able to tell at a glance if this was a valid UUID or not. It wouldn’t have been self-verifying.</p>
<p name="16e0" id="16e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I decided to name my UUID <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">This is not a valid UUID.</code>I wanted to easily be able to tell from the GET call if it succeeded, or the error message in the POST call if it failed. It would be clear when running or debugging the test what value was being passed in, why, and to which field it belongs.</p>
<p name="78ab" id="78ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Or so I thought.</p>
<p name="ca5b" id="ca5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I ran the test. This was the output.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2019/output.png"></p>
<p name="950f" id="950f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I sat starting at it for a while. The first line where the red <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">AssertionError</code> starts looks confusingly similar: The left side looks like the right, so the assert should have passed instead of failed. The message below had <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">is not a valid UUID</code> twice. Huh? Finally, I realized what I did, and highlighted the part you now see in blue. I gave my self-verifying test data a name too similar to the error message. Let me boil this down:</p>

<p name="a80f" id="a80f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Error message I expected: <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">UUID not valid</code><br>Error message I got: <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Published service UUID {{insert UUID here}} is not a valid UUID.</code></p>

<p name="a0fb" id="a0fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfortunately, I’d named my UUID <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">This is not a valid UUID.</code> so the whole invalid input error message was:</p>

<p name="9e42" id="9e42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Published service UUID This is not a valid UUID. is not a valid UUID.</code></p>

<p name="64d9" id="64d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fans of 30 Rock may recognize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh2k5YAnP8g" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh2k5YAnP8g" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this problem</a>:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2019/single-dropping.jpg"></p>
<p name="4fdd" id="4fdd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">My self-verifying test data would have worked fine if the error message was exactly how I expected it. The test would have passed, and I may not have taken a closer look at the text of the error message. But of course, my developers had changed it to be more meaningful and give more context, the bastards. Thus, I uncovered my perfect-turned-nonsensical name. I changed the UUID in my test data to be called<code class="markup--code markup--p-code">FAKE UUID</code>. It may not be the perfect name, but at least the code is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWiwDdx_rdo" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWiwDdx_rdo" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">better</a>.</p>

<p name="4f54" id="4f54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I was beyond excited to attend Agile Testing Days in Potsdam, Germany for the first time a year and a half ago. Anywhere I went, I met women who I’d previously only known from the internet. It was refreshing.</p>

<p name="bd6a" id="bd6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Based on the pages of notes I’ve got, I can tell you that the lessons I took away from that week have seeped into the way I work everyday.</p>

<blockquote name="14da" id="14da" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Humans should not be regression testing.”</blockquote>

<p name="d815" id="d815" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote"><a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble" data-href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jez Humble</a> kicked off the conference with a session about continuous delivery. He described the barriers of organizational culture and software architecture that can prevent you from getting to a point where you can deliver continuously. Previous places where I worked made this feel like an insurmountable feat; now when I imagine continuous delivery, I can imagine concrete steps we could take to get there.</p>

<blockquote name="0481" id="0481" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Let’s create a small habit everyday to trigger me to learn more.”</blockquote>

She’s been pair testing remotely with people around the world and learning so much from it. I’ve taken pairing on a smaller scale, with my colleagues or in-person. There are still times when it tests my patience, but the benefits of being able to more precisely explain what I’m doing and what I expect of the software vastly outweigh that investment. All my notes from Lisi’s talk have me nodding my head, like these are the most obvious things in the world. The biggest I’d come across about a year beforehand: having a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset. <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" data-href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This explanation from Brain Pickings sticks with me</a>.</p>

You know, like you do with your friends for fun, but on stage. It can be so hard to believe that people are acting with good intentions at heart. But remembering to have empathy for the situations people find themselves in will help you choose to be the person to repair relationships when things go awry. If you believe in people, they can be better.</p>

But I’m curious about this provocative statement. I haven’t ever worked at a place bold enough to get rid of managers whose direct reports displayed a pattern of escaping them that no one could ignore. I wonder what kind of company is bold enough to take this step.</p>

At my first job, we used a physical board with sticky notes. If the sticky note had been moved around too many times or stuck in one place too long, it would literally fall off the board. At the time this felt like a failure. Now I see it for the blessing it was. Forgetting is a part of life, even if our digital tools would prefer us to forget that.</p>

It’s resonating with me again now because it’s something I’m addressing in a talk I’m giving about how to build trust. I’m digging into authenticity, which I think goes a step beyond integrity. Doing what you say you will is being externally congruent. Authentic people are also internally congruent; the vision they have of themselves is the one they present to the world.</p>

We practiced observing the skills we were using on the meta-level. It allowed me to both see and share how much a year of mob testing for an hour every day had expanded at least two things. First: my field of vision for how to dig and explore software had grown. Second: I was able to explain what I was thinking such that the other people present could understand, contribute to, and question which path we’d take next. It was life-affirming!</p>

<blockquote name="b8f8" id="b8f8" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“When we set our own limits, we can change them.”</blockquote>

<p name="c8b4" id="c8b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">This came up in the context of Natalie Wenert’s talk about cross-team functionality. She chided organizations for relying on hero-worship and fire-fighting over breaking down silos and contributing to the whole. One of my conference buddies was frustrated at Agile Testing Days because they viewed so much of the content as “work therapy.” They weren’t wrong.</p>

<blockquote name="e6da" id="e6da" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“As a user, I want to be locked out of the system after three incorrect password attempts.”</blockquote>

This particular example made me laugh out loud. This story gets the “why” wrong. It’s about security of our system and the user’s data. Being honest about why we’re building the software would make the user story less absurd, and hopefully get us on the path to making better software too.</p>

(Shout out to all the people who’ve tweet me instead of this other brown-haired white lady with glasses!) I’m on my fifth team in a year at my current company. I’m tired of the change. I know how important it is to build relationships with the people you work with. I’ve expressed that knowing who’s on my team is more important than having the perfect set of people. I look forward to more stability there because I don’t envy the alternative.</p>

<p name="d0f0" id="d0f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I notice most of the error codes were <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">403</code> responses, so I try a few of those pages manually. Those few succeed, so I don’t bother checking the rest. A<code class="markup--code markup--p-code">403</code> status is <a href="https://httpstatuses.com/403" data-href="https://httpstatuses.com/403" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forbidden access</a>, so I think it has something to do with these sites having logins. But I don’t need to logins to see the pages I’m linking to. Then I notice that some of the pages are pointing to http instead of https. I don’t know exactly what’s wrong. It’s getting late, so rather than diving in, I write two bugs: <a href="https://github.com/ezagroba/linkchecker/issues/8" data-href="https://github.com/ezagroba/linkchecker/issues/8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one about investigating 403s</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ezagroba/linkchecker/issues/9" data-href="https://github.com/ezagroba/linkchecker/issues/9" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one about updating http to https</a>.</p>

<p name="442c" id="442c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next, I look at the other error codes. The <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">999</code> one I’ve seen before. It’s some weird LinkedIn thing. I don’t add a bug because it’s not interesting to fix. One site I’m not able to reach the domain of at all, so I message the owner to see if it’s still being maintained. The <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">404</code> codes are from sites that still exist where the pages have been taken down; fixable, but frustrating. They prove I spoke at these conferences. When these pages die, so does proof of my hard work. Sigh. I remove those links from my site, reload to confirm the fix made it to production, and run the script again. We’re down from 15 to 13 errors, as expected.</p>

<p name="da25" id="da25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we started to define what we wanted to build, we came across items that had to come first: come up with a proposal before we meet to review it with our stakeholders. Other items weren’t necessarily “blocked,” but would make more sense to pick up in a sequence. As my developers watched me painstakingly searched for completely forgettable JIRA story number so I could mark each story as “blocked” or “is blocked by,” one of my developers asked one of the best questions I heard all day: “Is there a way we can see this visually?”</p>

<p name="4007" id="4007" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My developer searched for JIRA solutions to this problem and came across a few that required <a href="https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Visual-overview-of-related-and-blocked-issues/qaq-p/757970" data-href="https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Visual-overview-of-related-and-blocked-issues/qaq-p/757970" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">admin access</a> or JIRA version 8. We spent a few minutes getting lost in the text and subsequently interactive credits on the About JIRA page. None of us noticed this yesterday, but the start screen for the game gave us the answer we needed: we have JIRA 7 (Roman numerals on the title page), not JIRA 8.</p>

<p name="6eb6" id="6eb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Without a big sheet of paper (we had post-its, but no where to stick them) or a whiteboard in the conference room we were crammed into, I pulled up my go-to tool for visualizations: <a href="https://www.edrawsoft.com/download-mindmaster.php" data-href="https://www.edrawsoft.com/download-mindmaster.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MindMaster</a>.

<p name="c35b" id="c35b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I added a bunch of <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Floating topics</code> and connected them with <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Relationship</code> arrows. We outlined the first group of stories that we’d collected into an epic. We fiddled a bit with aligning the stories that could be picked up in parallel so they appeared at the earliest point we could pick them up. We came back to refine and add a couple items as we outlined other epics. The few minutes we dedicated to creating this diagram gave us enough information to decide what order we should pick up work for the next week or two.</p>

(A yellow triangular yield symbol appeared next to the Network tab to remind me that I’d throttled my network.)

<ol class="postList">
<li name="8374" id="8374" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">I could see what API calls were being made.

<li name="ef06" id="ef06" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I could see which calls were redirects.

<p name="de62" id="de62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I discovered logging in and logging out took about 20 seconds on the test environment over Slow 3G. (This time appeared in the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Load</code> text in red at the bottom of the Network tab.) Was this too slow? To answer this question, I needed an oracle.</p>

<p name="7704" id="7704" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I decided to compare the behavior on the test environment to our production environment. On production, login took 60 seconds! When I sorted the network calls by <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Time</code>, I could see that the bulk of loading time was spent retrieving messages to display on the logged-in page. Both 20 and 60 seconds for a login seemed unacceptably slow to me, so I took it to my team.</p>

<p name="d153" id="d153" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My team agreed that this behavior was bad. Unfortunately, we decided to prioritize users on fast networks over users on slow ones, and changing this behavior wasn’t a priority for our release.</p>

<p name="f224" id="f224" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I sorted the network calls by <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Name</code>, I found some unexpected URLs I did not expect to be involved during a login.

<p name="00f1" id="00f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A few different times, we wrote some Python code to help us test our products. And then we threw the code out.</p>

<p name="ad39" id="ad39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We had the infrastructure in place to add tests to our continuous integration pipeline in Jenkins. It would have been as simple as merging the branch of our code into master. But it had served its purpose already.</p>

<h5 name="7e5f" id="7e5f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Example 1: web feature integrating with desktop software</h5>

<p name="1da2" id="1da2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Our team owner a web-based product. It had lots of features, but the two we were concerned with for this were: it created an account and a project. These would be used in a desktop product built by different teams at our company. For this story, a flag would be set when you created a project in our product to allow for something new in the desktop software.</p>

<p name="9663" id="9663" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our testing stack was built and maintained by our team alone. It was set up to look at the web UI and APIs, but not the desktop software. We had APIs to create projects and change this new project flag. We didn’t have an automated way to see exactly what would happen in the desktop software under these different circumstances.</p>

<p name="c2c2" id="c2c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We wrote tests to query the APIs to see that the settings we set were coming back as expected. Those went into the pipeline. We also wrote some Python code to create projects in each of the five different states. Then, we manually went into the desktop software, used each of the projects we created, and looked at what happened in the desktop software. The information we discovered was enough to determine that the work for our team and the work for the desktop software teams was complete.</p>

<p name="8f6c" id="8f6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We did not add these tests to the pipeline. The branch got removed from the project without getting merged into master once the story was completed.</p>

<h5 name="5b5e" id="5b5e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Example 2: crude performance test</h5>

<p name="a60d" id="a60d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We wanted to simulate the load placed on our product by a different internal app. Unfortunately the owner of the internal app was unavailable in the short period of time we had to complete this task. To do this, we took existing feature tests we had running on our staging environments, parallelize them, and run them on a clone of our production environment.</p>

<p name="4cc3" id="4cc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our production clone was available during the few days we were doing this test. It would not be available thereafter, considering the time and money we would have to invest in maintaining it. Our other staging environments had a different enough capacity that running a performance test there would not be meaningful. Our production environment would give us the information we needed once we released this build because the internal app ran there. We maintained a branch for a few days while we were writing and using the performance test, but without an environment to run it on, we threw it out.</p>

<h5 name="eea5" id="eea5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Example 3: audit trail Excel export</h5>

<p name="fc7f" id="fc7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We added an audit trail to our profile information for GDPR compliance. Our system could display the information in the UI and export it to Excel. We added tests to our pipeline for the UI bit. The exporting to Excel bit we didn’t. We wrote a test that ended by providing us a username and password. Manually, we’d login, go to the page with the Excel export, and confirm that the data in the file matched the changes the test had made.</p>

<p name="c098" id="c098" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Excel exporter wasn’t a piece of code our team maintained. If this test failed, it would have likely been in that functionality, since we also had a UI test for the data integrity. We weren’t changing anything about the Excel export. The audit trail report was an important enough feature that we knew we’d smoke test it manually with every release, so we didn’t add this code to the repository.</p>

<p name="af15" id="af15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">My first job after college was with a contractor to the United States Navy. I had to get a security clearance from the U.S. government to have access to classified data, the lowest category. One piece of the application was getting fingerprinted. From there, federal agencies like the FBI would check my fingerprints against criminal records databases to see if any matches turned up.</p>

<p name="7241" id="7241" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked down to the local police station in my college town of Waterville, Maine, which is not exactly a bustling metropolis. I expected a police officer to compare my picture on the driver’s license I’d brought with my actual face to confirm my identity, before taking my fingerprints and shipping them off to the appropriate authority.</p>

<p name="0ffc" id="0ffc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But they did not.</p>

<p><span class="img_container" style="display: inline-block;"><img alt="" src="images/posts/2019/fingerprints.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="flickr/cogdog"><span class="img_caption" style="display: block; text-align: center;">flickr/cogdog</span></span></p>
<p name="f72c" id="f72c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">First, when I arrived at the station, I was told to wait. “We’re questioning a suspect in the booking room!” This was clearly the most action these officers had seen in a while. They were psyched. But I was puzzled about why this was an impediment, so naturally I asked more questions: “Can you tell me more about the ink pad? Is it secured to the table in some fashion? Would it be possible to continue questioning the subject, but take my fingerprints out here in the hallway?”</p>

<p name="8262" id="8262" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After explaining this to two different officers and lots more waiting, they discovered that the ink pad was indeed able to be transported by human hands to interact with mine. They filled out the form with my name and some other details I provided verbally and took my fingerprints. I left.</p>

<p name="adeb" id="adeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was only after I got back to campus that I realized the crucial step the police officers missed: they forgot to look at my driver’s license. They were so thrown off from their usual routine, both by having a suspect in custody and by moving the fingerprint pad to a different location, that they forgot to verify my identity.</p>

<p name="6e0d" id="6e0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have no criminal record, I was only at the job for a short time, and my security clearance expired after five years without getting renewed, so the mistake was of no consequence.</p>

<p name="6b10" id="6b10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But consider the alternative: I have a criminal record. I send my sister or a friend who knew enough about me to the police station. They impersonate me, and the fingerprint check of their prints turns up no suspicious activity. Now I have security clearance to access classified data about the American military when I shouldn’t.</p>

<p name="e1e9" id="e1e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The moral of this story: authentication and authorization go hand-in-hand. Authorization could have been circumvented by an unauthorized impersonator without the additional check of authentication. Putting someone in a particular security group is not enough: you’ve got to check that it’s them who’s supposed to be there.</p>
